Special thanks to Peerlyst Community for mentioning me on the [list (27_Influential_Penetration_Testers)](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/Some_Pentesters_SecurityResearchers_RedTeamers/blob/main/27_Influential_Penetration_Testers_by_Peerlyst.pdf)
 but for me, "john" from Purple team [https://lnkd.in/eVfKuah] + these guys in below list are Influential Security Researchers/Pentesters/Red Teamers...
------------------- 

Note: in my opinion they have/had good researches & codes + videos (i learned a lot useful things from these guys), this is not all of them in my list & you can make your own list better than me ;D ...
