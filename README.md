# Some_Pentesters_SecurityResearchers_RedTeamers

Special thanks to Peerlyst Community for mentioning me on the [list (27_Influential_Penetration_Testers)](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/Some_Pentesters_SecurityResearchers_RedTeamers/blob/main/27_Influential_Penetration_Testers_by_Peerlyst.pdf)
 but for me, "john" from Purple team [https://lnkd.in/eVfKuah] + these guys in below list are Influential Security Researchers/Pentesters/Red Teamers...
----------------

Note: in my opinion they have/had good researches & codes + videos (i learned a lot useful things from these guys), this is not all of them in my list & you can make your own list better than me ;D ...

Some Videos About Pentesters & Red/Purple/Blue Teams (Offensive/Defensive teams + SOC/CTI...), these Videos made by Security Researchers/Pentesters/Red/Purple/Blue Teamers...
---

Note: i think you should watch these videos one by one, As Pentester/Red/Blue/Purple Teamer (Security Teams) these videos will help you a lot... (these video was useful to me a lot, but this list was for New Videos & i will add more videos (new/old videos) to this new list soon...

Note: these guys in these videos are "humble" which is important to me & their videos is very useful (technically).

"Humble" + "Useful" + "Pro" = "these guys ;D in this video list ..."
